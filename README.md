# Seven Wonders
Seven Wonders is a game that can include 3 to 4 persons each play. The game starts by making each player leader of one of the Seven Wonders(which includes Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Temple of Artemis, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse of Alexandria). The game is made up of 3 ages such as Ages I, II and III and leaders are suppose to collect enough resources to place structures on their respective wonders. At the end of each age leaders fight with their consecutive neighbours, the result of these wars are based on military power which is again determined by how many military cards you have. At the end of Age III winner is determined by how many structures, wins and victory cards the players have.
